# Task Manager Project in Java

This is my very first Java project, and I've spent a good amount of time learning and building it. I mainly relied on YouTube videos and tutorials to figure things out.

## Project Overview

This Task Manager is a basic program that helps you manage your tasks. I've made it so you can create tasks, group them into projects, mark them as done, and even set reminders. It's all done through a simple text interface in your console.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Create, list, mark as completed, and set reminders for tasks.
- **Project Organization:** Categorize tasks into projects for better organization.
- **Statistics:** View statistics on the total number of tasks, completed tasks, and tasks with reminders.
- **Persistence:** Save tasks to a file (`tasks.ser`) for persistent storage between sessions.

## How to Use

To run the Task Manager, just run the TaskManager.java file. The program will give you a menu to interact with different features.

```bash
java TaskManager.java
