# Task Manager Project in Java

Welcome to my Task Manager project implemented in Java! This project serves as my first venture into Java programming, and I've dedicated a significant amount of time to its development. I've been on a learning journey, exploring Java syntax, concepts, and best practices through a combination of watching YouTube videos and consulting various tutorials.

## Project Overview

This Task Manager is a console-based application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create tasks, set priorities, mark tasks as completed, and even set reminders. Tasks can be categorized into projects, providing an organized way to manage different aspects of your workload.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Create, list, mark as completed, and set reminders for tasks.
- **Project Organization:** Categorize tasks into projects for better organization.
- **Statistics:** View statistics on the total number of tasks, completed tasks, and tasks with reminders.
- **Persistence:** Save tasks to a file (`tasks.ser`) for persistent storage between sessions.

## How to Use

To run the Task Manager, simply execute the `TaskManager.java` file. The application will prompt you with a menu, allowing you to interact with various features.

```bash
java TaskManager.java
